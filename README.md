# Limboid Robot Services

- Industry as a Service
- An automated factory
- capitalizing high operational complexity processes that can be performed in a small space
- marketed at an enterprise scale
- while still being accessible to an ordinary person

## Concepts

- Ingress/egress port/dock: perimeter of complex where raw goods are transported to/from pallets and trucks or railcars
- Transporter: intra-complex pallete logistics vehichle
- Thing: fundamental unit of workpiece/cargo/life-form
- Pallet: carries all things
- Shelf: structure to hold multiple pallets of a specified size range. Comes in multiple sizes
- Container: structure to hold pallets and shelves with a closed or open environment. Comes in multiple sizes
- Room: physical room where containers and stations are located
- Complex: physical site providing utilities to buildings; often same as building
- Environment: the environmental conditions shared by a pallet/shelf/container/room. Can have constaints on the materials/life allowed inside. Environments provide environment-specific services their constuients. Examples: water mist, temperature control, camera recording, sensor data collection, etc. 
- Station: physical processing unit
- Limboid: general labor unit
- Process: fundamental operation. Performed by environment, station, or limboid(s). Processes are executed on demand, spot request, or reservation.
- Workflow: synchonous or asynchonous, heirarchiel process program. Written in Python or node using imperitive, object oriented, or declarative format. (Declarative format may be ambiguous) Maybe also support for GUI drag-and-drop languages. Maybe also support for natural language documents.
