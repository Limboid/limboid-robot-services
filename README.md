# Limboid Robot Services

## Principles

- An automated factory
- capitalizing high operational complexity processes
- that can be performed in a small space
- and marketed at an enterprise scale
- while still being accessible to an ordinary person

## Concepts

- Materials
- Ingress / egress port / dock: area of complex where raw goods are transported to/from pallates and trucks or railcars
- Transporter: intra-complex pallete logistics vehichle
